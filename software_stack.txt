[DeckBox and AUV software stack definitions]


-DeckBox GUI
	remoteRX: recieves data from input devices such as a USB controller or PPM data over serial via the arduino and serves that data to other programs via a named pipe
	dataRX: recieves data from the AUV over a C/C++ socket and serves that data to other programs via a named pipe
	takeControl: recieves input from the deckBox-GUI program and remoteRX and sends that data to the AUV over a C/C++ socket 


-AUV
	-Rasperry Pi
		dataTX: recieves data from named pipes served by programs such as sensorRX and send that data to the deckBox via a C/C++ socket
		motorControl: recieves data over a C/C++ socket from takeControl and relays that information over serial (USB) to the Pico which will then generate PWM signals to drive the ESCs
		sensorRX: recieves data over various protocols from sensors such as the IMU or leak detectors and relays that data over a named pipe to dataTX

	-Pico/Arduino
		pico_software: recieves control data from the Pi over serial (USB) and generates PWM signals to control the ESCs
