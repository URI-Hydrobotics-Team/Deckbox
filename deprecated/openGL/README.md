This is an OpenGL based gui for the deckbox, based on glText (text library for OpenGL). This is built completely from the ground up and currently supports recieving data from the remoteRX program and displaying it via graphical bars. This replaces the FLTK and Xforms interfaces for the C/C++ based deckbox gui.

#Compilation Instructions
Make sure the depencies are satisfied and run the build.sh script. A makefile will be implemented soon.
